How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped to quickly identify the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It can help if I need to roll back to see where an error occurred.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
With code it will keep versions that compile or actually run.  But it can tend to be too big.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
VC systems for code realize that files are interdependent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log to see committs.  Git Diff to see the changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because it would be easy to roll back to working code.
