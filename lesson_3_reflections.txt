When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When using multiple computers or collaborating with people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case the remote repository has changed after I already started working on my local copy.
