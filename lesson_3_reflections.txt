When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When using multiple computers or collaborating with people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case the remote repository has changed after I already started working on my local copy.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of another person's repository that i would use to make changes on if I dont' have permissions on the original.  A clone is just a copy that I would pull down from the remote or from another location.  A branch is a deviation from the master.
